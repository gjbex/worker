Some examples of how to use the worker framework with several languages
and applications.

## What is it?
1. `bash_example`: computation done by a Bash script.
1. `r_example`: computation done by an R script.
1. `job_array_example`: example of submitting a worker job that emulates
    PBS torque job array functionality.
1. `matlab_example`: computation done by a Matlab script. (Note: this
    will use a license per concurrent work item, compile the Matlab
